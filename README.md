## Discoveries

- 5948 files (3305 for 2008, 2643 for 2012)
- 97 [files with XML problems](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19RqAj--Pj2HqHyv5Ipcpz_ydDOHHgvMusEM4N5b1zJo/edit?usp=sharing)
  (fixed as of revision 45da629)
- different date formats:
  - 2008 uses yyyy-MM-dd
  - 2012 uses yyyyMMddHHmmss
- 2012 has no `<coverage>` tags
- Most `<source>` (i.e. URL fragment) tags in the 2008 data appear to map to distinct `<coverage>` values, which
  might be a starting point for populating the 2012 `<coverage>` data
- Subjects in both 2008 and 2012 datasets are sometimes distinct, multiple `<subject>` tags (probably correct) and
  sometimes just single tags with a long list of words / phrases (probably wrong)
- At least some subject keywords are junk (punctuation marks), unhelpful (numbers), or mangled (keywords with brackets,
  quotes, or other punctuation marks)
